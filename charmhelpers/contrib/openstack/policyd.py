Policy.d helper functions
=========================

The functions in this module are designed, as a set, to provide an easy-to-use
set of hooks for classic charms to add in /etc/<service-name>/policy.d/
directory override YAML files.

(For charms.openstack charms, a mixin class is provided for this
functionality).

In order to "hook" this functionality into a (classic) charm, two functions are
provided:

    maybe_do_policyd_overrides(openstack_release,
                               service,
                               blacklist_paths=none,
                               blacklist_keys=none,
                               template_function=none,
                               restart_handler=none)

    maybe_do_policyd_overrides_on_config_changed(openstack_release,
                                                 service,
                                                 blacklist_paths=None,
                                                 blacklist_keys=None,
                                                 template_function=None,
                                                 restart_handler=None

(See the docstrings for details on the parameters)

The functions should be called from the install and upgrade hooks in the charm.
The `maybe_do_policyd_overrides_on_config_changed` function is designed to be
called on the config-changed hook, in that it does an additional check to
ensure that an already overriden policy.d in an upgrade or install hooks isn't
repeated.

In order the *enable* this functionality, the charm's install, config_changed,
and upgrade_charm hooks need to be modified, and a new config option (see
below) needs to be added.  The README for the charm should also be updated.

Examples from the keystone charm are:

@hooks.hook('install.real')
@harden()
def install():
    ...
    # call the policy overrides handler which will install any policy overrides
    maybe_do_policyd_overrides(os_release('keystone'), 'keystone')


@hooks.hook('config-changed')
@restart_on_change(restart_map(), restart_functions=restart_function_map())
@harden()
def config_changed():
    ...
    # call the policy overrides handler which will install any policy overrides
    maybe_do_policyd_overrides_on_config_changed(os_release('keystone'),
                                                 'keystone')

@hooks.hook('upgrade-charm')
@restart_on_change(restart_map(), stopstart=True)
@harden()
def upgrade_charm():
    ...
    # call the policy overrides handler which will install any policy overrides
    maybe_do_policyd_overrides(os_release('keystone'), 'keystone')

Status Line
===========

The workload status code in charm-helpers has been modified to detect if
policy.d override code has been incorporated into the charm by checking for the
new config variable (in the config.yaml).  If it has been, then the workload
status line will automatically show "PO:" at the beginning of the workload
status for that unit/service if the config option is set.  If the policy
override is broken, the "PO (broken):" will be shown.  No changes to the charm
(apart from those already mentioned) are needed to enable this functionality.
(charms.openstack charms also get this functionality, but please see that
library for further details).
"""

# The config.yaml for the charm should contain the following for the config
# option:

"""
  use-policyd-override:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True then use the resource file named 'policyd-override' to install
      override YAML files in the service's policy.d directory.  The resource
      file should be a ZIP file containing at least one yaml file with a .yaml
      or .yml extension.  If False then remove the overrides.
"""

# The metadata.yaml for the charm should contain the following:
"""
resources:

# The README for the charm should contain the following:
"""
Policy Overrides
----------------

This feature allows for policy overrides using the `policy.d` directory.  This
is an **advanced** feature and the policies that the OpenStack service supports
should be clearly and unambiguously understood before trying to override, or
add to, the default policies that the service uses.  The charm also has some
policy defaults.  They should also be understood before being overridden.

> **Caution**: It is possible to break the system (for tenants and other
  services) if policies are incorrectly applied to the service.

Policy overrides are YAML files that contain rules that will add to, or
override, existing policy rules in the service.  The `policy.d` directory is
a place to put the YAML override files.  This charm owns the
`/etc/keystone/policy.d` directory, and as such, any manual changes to it will
be overwritten on charm upgrades.

Overrides are provided to the charm using a Juju resource called
`policyd-override`.  The resource is a ZIP file.  This file, say
`overrides.zip`, is attached to the charm by:


    juju attach-resource <charm-name> policyd-override=overrides.zip

The policy override is enabled in the charm using:

    juju config <charm-name> use-policyd-override=true

When `use-policyd-override` is `True` the status line of the charm will be
prefixed with `PO:` indicating that policies have been overridden.  If the
installation of the policy override YAML files failed for any reason then the
status line will be prefixed with `PO (broken):`.  The log file for the charm
will indicate the reason.  No policy override files are installed if the `PO
(broken):` is shown.  The status line indicates that the overrides are broken,
not that the policy for the service has failed. The policy will be the defaults
for the charm and service.

Policy overrides on one service may affect the functionality of another
service. Therefore, it may be necessary to provide policy overrides for
multiple service charms to achieve a consistent set of policies across the
OpenStack system.  The charms for the other services that may need overrides
should be checked to ensure that they support overrides before proceeding.

    is only supported on openstack_release "queens" or later, and on ubuntu
    "xenial" or later.  Prior to these versions, this feature is a NOP.

    The optional template_function is a function that accepts a string and has
    an opportunity to modify the loaded file prior to it being read by
    yaml.safe_load().  This allows the charm to perform "templating" using
    charm derived data.

    The param blacklist_paths are paths (that are in the service's policy.d
    directory that should not be touched).

    The param blacklist_keys are keys that must not appear in the yaml file.
    If they do, then the whole policy.d file fails.

    The yaml file extracted from the resource_file (which is a zipped file) has
    its file path reconstructed.  This, also, must not match any path in the
    black list.

    The param restart_handler is an optional Callable that is called to perform
    the service restart if the policy.d file is changed.  This should normally
    be None as oslo.policy automatically picks up changes in the policy.d
    directory.  However, for any services where this is buggy then a
    restart_handler can be used to force the policy.d files to be read.

    different: It will only perform the policyd overrides if the config is True

    The optional template_function is a function that accepts a python
    string and has an opportunity to modify the document
    prior to it being read by the yaml.safe_load() function and written to
    disk. Note that this function does *not* say how the templating is done -
    this is up to the charm to implement its chosen method.

    The param blacklist_paths are paths (that are in the service's policy.d
    directory that should not be touched).

    The param blacklist_keys are keys that must not appear in the yaml file.
    If they do, then the whole policy.d file fails.

    The yaml file extracted from the resource_file (which is a zipped file) has
    its file path reconstructed.  This, also, must not match any path in the
    black list.

    The yaml filename can be modified in two ways.  If the `preserve_topdir`
    param is True, then files will be flattened to the top dir.  This allows
    for creating sets of files that can be grouped into a single level tree
    structure.

    Secondly, if the `preprocess_filename` param is not None and callable()
    then the name is passed to that function for preprocessing before being
    converted to the end location.  This is to allow munging of the filename
    prior to being tested for a blacklist path.

    If any error occurs, then the policy.d directory is cleared, the error is
    written to the log, and the status line will eventually show as failed.
